# BTai - GitHub Release

BTai, an all in one for my projects or yours. BTai has numourus features to note, and numorous hours to make. 

~~ Features ~~

AI Chat or Image Generation (This will be a seperate git for the AI model, 60B free chatting with BTi image generation, more on that soon.)

-

Project Hosting (What is it? Well, like github, but for code, apps, and VMs. Two of your first Projects hosted on the BT network will have a max ram of 3GB, 30GB of fast SSD, and a variety of Linux OSs to choose from. Projects are on the cloud with maximum protection, only pay for after using two free premium VM slots. Free ones cap at 512MB ram and 5GB HDD, for small linux projects.)

-

Game Interconnection (This app also has for making games. Only you can make one free game, rest are paid. Maximum game storage for free/paid, 56GB. A game project includes a no cost testing environment, which is a locked environment where it can only run your game.)

-

BTnet (BT's network paging. Have a VM from an other provider and the virtual ethernet/internet sucks? Swap to BTnet by simply contacting your provider when we launch. 6GB per second max limits on nodes.)

-

BTnodes (Want to host a discord bot, or make webhooks? Sign up for the Essentials plan and get 3 nodes, where you can put a bot on two and webhook on one. Beware that using discord bots on the BTnode platform will add some ms of lag, depending on node load. (5-6ms, guaranteed to max out at 8ms)

# Thats it for the plans.

Yup, ill add more later, thats what my coding expertise and servers can do right now.

## BTnodes/BTprojects Servers
The servers are hosted on unbranded motherboards, with 500 Gf2 (best plan) nodes and 350 rest, meaning that 850 nodes will be in one place. I plan to set out server locations in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Florida, Oklahoma, and a high-availability masterband (5,000 nodes planned with ultra connection) in the middle of Washington DC.

## Live Progress of Development
5% - Setting up servers, 
5 nodes available, 10 testing envs available, Los Angeles only location online,
5 game nodes available, studio unavailable,
10 AI servers available, chat and model being trained at the time of stating,
5 BTimg Basic servers available, image model being trained at the time of stating,
0 running VM nodes,
0 available VM nodes to use,
0 AI model nodes online,
5 AI models being trained,
6 BTimg models being trained,
332 nodes being configured,
1281 nodes existing,
558 nodes offline,
2 nodes operating under OS prep,
51 nodes to go.
